# Clone of the board game Tapple for the Playdate device: 
# Select a category, use the crank to choose a starting letter and give an example of an item that fits the category 
# out loud within 15 seconds.
# Pass the device to the next player. Continue until someone's time runs out or you run out of letters.
# Have fun!
